# Original C-130 Model:
Author: [Shyam Murali](https://grabcad.com/library/iaf-lockheed-martin-c-130j-super-hercules-1)

Appears to be C-130J Extended Forward Fuselage

# Objective
Modification to a Solid Works C-130H or C-130J 3D model for 3D printing with either PLA or PETG on a Prusa i3 Mk3s. 

# Modifications
These files will use a form of the British small arms numbering system. Small changes are indicated by the addition of an asterisk ('star', *) to the Mk ('Mark') number. The numbering will be done in roman numerals

## Current Modification Versions
* Mk V
  - First modification attempt
  - All parts designed to fit together with 3D printed 'keys'
  - No model scaling in Solid Works. Model is scaled in the slicer
  - Separate parts are created by cutting the original model at strategic locations
  - The parts are converted to .stl files and then sliced using PrusaSlicer2 or Simplify 3D
* Mk V*
  - Small modifications to the Mk V design
* Mk VI
  - Complete re-work of the Mk V design
  - Uses combination of 3D printed 'keys' and metal fasteners
  - Re-work started after realization that printing the empennage in one piece is not going to work out without soluble support
  - Model is scaled in SolidWorks to 25% the original size from Shyam's 3D model
      - If a different scale is needed the 3D model will have to be significantly re-worked in SolidWorks
* Mk VI*
  - Minor changes to the Mk VI design
  - Does away with the M3 screws between the Forward-Center Fuselage boundary to affix the Wing Center Box to the Center Fuselage. 
  - Instead screws will be mounted vertically to affix the Wing Center Box to the Center Fuselage
